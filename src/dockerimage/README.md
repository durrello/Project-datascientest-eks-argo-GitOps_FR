To push a Docker image to Docker Hub, follow these steps:

### 0. Build your Docker image locally (if not already built):

```bash
docker build -t my-terraform-awscli-image .
```

### 1. Log in to Docker Hub

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
docker login
```
You will be prompted to enter your Docker Hub username and password. Once successful, you are logged in.

### 2. Tag your Docker image for Docker Hub

Docker Hub images need to be tagged with your Docker Hub username and repository name. For example, if your Docker Hub username is `myusername` and your image is named `myimage`, tag your local image like this:

```bash
docker tag myimage:latest myusername/myimage:latest
```

### 3. Push the image to Docker Hub

Run the push command with your tagged image:

```bash
docker push myusername/myimage:latest
```

Docker will upload the image layers to Docker Hub, and once done, your image will be available in your Docker Hub repository.


Replace `myusername`, `myimage`, and tags with your actual Docker Hub username, image name, and tag.

This process allows you to share your Docker images publicly or privately through Docker Hub for easier deployment and collaboration.
